Experiment Lifting a Mechanical Load with DC-motor

***This project is part of AVE3 pratical course for Modelling and Simulation.
This experiment is a combination of both electrical and mechanical systerm. 
The electrical circuit of DC motor is converted into rotational torque which is transformed into purely translational motion.
Determination of parameters is carried out and simulation results are evaluated by the experimental data.
